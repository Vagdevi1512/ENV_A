# 🪸 Coral Classification using MobileNetV2
### Deep Learning Model for Coral Health Detection (TensorFlow/Keras)

A deep-learning project to classify coral images into **two categories** using **MobileNetV2 transfer learning**.  
The project includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, visualization, and exporting the model in both **H5** and **TFLite** formats for mobile/edge deployment.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

Each subfolder must contain images downloaded from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aneeshdighe/corals-classification
Here the Training, Validation, Testing should be extracted from downloads and keep these separately in the folder where remaining code is present
```
Training/
    ├── bleached_corals/
    └── healthy_corals/

Validation/
    ├── bleached_corals/
    └── healthy_corals/

Testing/
    ├── bleached_corals/
    └── healthy_corals/
```
